                <h3>Simple Calculator Web Application</h3>
                <p>
                    A simple calculator web app is a user-friendly and straightforward online tool that allows users to
                    perform basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, on
                    numerical values. Users can input two numbers and choose the desired operation from the available
                    options. The web app then computes the result and displays it to the user. It typically includes
                    error handling to prevent division by zero and provides a convenient way to perform quick
                    calculations without the need for a physical calculator. Simple calculator web apps are commonly
                    used for basic mathematical tasks and are easily accessible through web browsers on various devices.
